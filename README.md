# Postal-Mail-Tracking-Delivery-System
📦 **Postal MAIL Tracking & Delivery System
INFO 5707 – Data Modeling Project | Group 13**

A robust database-driven postal delivery system designed to enhance shipment tracking, improve delivery transparency, and provide structured customer feedback. Developed as a part of the INFO 5707 course, this project focuses on optimizing postal logistics using efficient data modeling techniques.

🎯 **Objective:**
To develop a system that:

Tracks package statuses (pending, in transit, failed, delivered)

Records all delivery attempts with timestamps and reasons

Stores digital proof of delivery (signature/photo)

Collects customer feedback (ratings and comments)

Calculates dynamic shipping charges based on distance, weight, and base fees

🛠️ **Features:**
Entity-Relationship Design (ERD): Covers all key components such as Customers, Packages, Drivers, Routes, Payment, Feedback, and Delivery Proof.

**SQL Implementation:** Includes table creation, insertions, and optimized queries for tracking, billing, and delivery monitoring.

**Data Dictionary:** Clearly outlines all attributes for each entity to support database logic and maintain data integrity.

**Insightful Queries:**

Failed deliveries

Total shipping cost per customer

Out-for-delivery packages with drivers/routes

Delivery status summaries

Returned-to-sender and successful delivery logs

📈 **Future Enhancements:**
SMS/email delivery notifications

Web/mobile interface for customers

Admin/staff login with role-based access

Visual delivery route mapping

QR code-based tracking

Advanced feedback and issue resolution tracking
